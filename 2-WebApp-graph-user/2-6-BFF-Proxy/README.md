## Overview

This sample demonstrates a React single-page application with an ASP.NET Core backend authenticating users and calling the Microsoft Graph API using the backend for frontend proxy pattern.

> :information_source: To learn how applications integrate with [Microsoft Graph](https://aka.ms/graph), consider going through the recorded session: [An introduction to Microsoft Graph for developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBbnpFdB92A)

## Scenario

1. The client ASP.NET Core web app uses **Microsoft.Identity.Web** to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT [ID Token](https://aka.ms/id-tokens) and an [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) from **Azure AD**.
1. The **access token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to call the Microsoft Graph protected by **Azure AD**.

![Scenario Image](./ReadmeFiles/topology.png)

## Prerequisites

* Either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started)
* An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/test-setup-environment#get-a-test-tenant)
* A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.

>This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. If you're signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal Microsoft account and have not created a user account in your directory before, you will need to create one before proceeding.

## Setup the sample

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-aspnetcore-webapp-openidconnect-v2.git
```

or download and extract the repository *.zip* file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Navigate to project folder

```console
    cd 2-WebApp-graph-user/2-6-BFF-Proxy/CallGraphBFF
```

### Step 3. Trust development certificates

```console
   dotnet dev-certs https --clean
   dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

For more information and potential issues, see: [HTTPS in .NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/enforcing-ssl).

### Step 4: Register the sample application(s) in your tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

    > :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
  
    1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
    1. In PowerShell run:

       ```PowerShell
       Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
       ```

    1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
    1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

       ```PowerShell
       cd .\AppCreationScripts\
       .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
       ```

    > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.
    
        > :information_source: This sample can make use of client certificates. You can use **AppCreationScripts** to register an Azure AD application with certificates. See: [How to use certificates instead of client secrets](./README-use-certificate.md)

</details>

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

To manually register the apps, as a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the client app (CallGraphBFF)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `CallGraphBFF`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URI:
        1. `https://localhost:7000/api/auth/signin-oidc`
        1. `https://localhost:7000/api/auth/signout-oidc`
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Certificates & secrets** blade in the left to open the page where you can generate secrets and upload certificates.
1. In the **Client secrets** section, select **New client secret**:
    1. Type a key description (for instance `app secret`).
    1. Select one of the available key durations (**6 months**, **12 months** or **Custom**) as per your security posture.
    1. The generated key value will be displayed when you select the **Add** button. Copy and save the generated value for use in later steps.
    1. You'll need this key later in your code's configuration files. This key value will not be displayed again, and is not retrievable by any other means, so make sure to note it from the Azure portal before navigating to any other screen or blade.
    > :warning: For enhanced security, consider using **certificates** instead of client secrets. See: [How to use certificates instead of secrets](./README-use-certificate.md).
1. Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is is required by apps signing-in users.
    1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs:
    1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
    1. Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
    1. In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, select **Microsoft Graph**
    1. In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    1. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

##### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select **optional claim type**, then choose **ID**.
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

##### Configure the client app (CallGraphBFF) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `2-6-BFF-Proxy/CallGraphBFF/appsettings.json` file.
1. Find the key `TenantId` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant/directory ID.
1. Find the key `ClientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `CallGraphBFF` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `ClientSecret` and replace the existing value with the generated secret that you saved during the creation of `CallGraphBFF` copied from the Azure portal.

### Step 5: Running the sample

From your shell or command line, execute the following commands:

```console
    cd 2-WebApp-graph-user/2-6-BFF-Proxy/CallGraphBFF
    dotnet run
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:7000`.
1. Select the **Login** button on the navigation bar to sign-in.
1. Select the **Profile** button on the navigation bar to call Microsoft Graph.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
	<summary>Expand for troubleshooting info</summary>

ASP.NET core applications create session cookies that represent the identity of the caller. Some Safari users using iOS 12 had issues which are described in ASP.NET Core #4467 and the Web kit bugs database Bug 188165 - iOS 12 Safari breaks ASP.NET Core 2.1 OIDC authentication.

If your web site needs to be accessed from users using iOS 12, you probably want to disable the SameSite protection, but also ensure that state changes are protected with CSRF anti-forgery mechanism. See the how to fix section of Microsoft Security Advisory: iOS12 breaks social, WSFed and OIDC logins #4647

### Deploying Web app to Azure App Service

There is one web app in this sample. To deploy it to **Azure App Services**, you'll need to:

- create an **Azure App Service**
- publish the projects to the **App Services**, and
- update its client(s) to call the website instead of the local environment.

#### Publish your files (CallGraphBFF)

##### Publish using Visual Studio

Follow the link to [Publish with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/deployment/quickstart-deploy-to-azure).

##### Publish using Visual Studio Code

1. Install the Visual Studio Code extension [Azure App Service](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azureappservice).
1. Follow the link to [Publish with Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/tutorials/publish-to-azure-webapp-using-vscode)

#### Update the Azure AD app registration (CallGraphBFF)

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the `CallGraphBFF` application.
1. In the app's registration screen, select **Authentication** in the menu.
    1. In the **Redirect URIs** section, update the reply URLs to match the site URL of your Azure deployment. For example:
        1. `https://callgraphbff.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/signin-oidc`
        1. `https://callgraphbff.azurewebsites.net/api/auth/signout-oidc`

> :warning: If your app is using an *in-memory* storage, **Azure App Services** will spin down your web site if it is inactive, and any records that your app was keeping will be empty. In addition, if you increase the instance count of your website, requests will be distributed among the instances. Your app's records, therefore, will not be the same on each instance.
